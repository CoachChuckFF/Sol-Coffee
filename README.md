# Hi!
I decided to make a simple reference repository that includes sample projects, maybe it'll help people start their own projects! 

My coding style is... verbose - so if anything hopefully this is helpful!

I plan on adding to this as I continue my Solana web journey!

## What this github contains
**Here I use React for web and Anchor for solana.**

### sol-smart-contracts
This contains notes and examples of smart contracts written in rust with anchor, tests are written in regular node js. Be sure to read the README!

### web-app-examples
This contains notes and examples of simple React web apps. Be sure to read the README!

## Start Here
Start HERE: [Buildspace's Solana Tutorial](https://app.buildspace.so/) - this is where I got my start. You should to!
